# Code Efficiency

Code efficency refers to a code that's capable to do an effcient usage of the available resources of the device it's running. 

## Things to avoid

### Memory leaks

A memory leak is when somethng is keeping doing requests or using memory when its not necessary, because that we need to make a cleanup functiion to remove this actions that may cause a memory leak

### Too much weight of the page

As same as before, our page may be running in phones if some user has an old device and our page is very heavy maybe will be slow, and also we're not doing an efficient usage of the network.

### Too many requests done

We dont need to make useless requests, because this may slowdown our page as we'll have tasks in background running and using network data.

## What can we do to be efficient?

We need to use an efficient usage of the web, and we have a lot of features that can help us, and also we can make our code efficient:

### Efficient usage of the network

If we can not download an image, we should avoid it, because normally he people has a limit of network usage in phones, and if our page has a lot of images may be slow and use a lot of network resources.

### Gzip

Gzip is a way to compress our pages, it's the most used type of compression, if we compress our pages with Gzip that page will be lighter and therefore more faster and efficient
