# Creational patterns

## Factory

Factory Method is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

The Factory Method pattern suggests that you replace direct object construction calls \(using the `new` operator\) with calls to a special _factory_ method, the objects are still created via the `new` operator, but itâ€™s being called from within the factory method. Objects returned by a factory method are often referred to as _products._

In this JavaScript example the `Factory` object creates four different types of employees. Each employee type has a different hourly rate. The `createEmployee` method is the actual Factory Method. The client instructs the factory what type of employee to create by passing a type argument into the Factory Method

```javascript
var Factory = function () {
    this.createEmployee = function (type) {
        var employee;

        if (type === "fulltime") {
            employee = new FullTime();
        } else if (type === "parttime") {
            employee = new PartTime();
        } else if (type === "temporary") {
            employee = new Temporary();
        } else if (type === "contractor") {
            employee = new Contractor();
        }

        employee.type = type;

        employee.say = function () {
            console.log(this.type + ": rate " + this.hourly + "/hour");
        }

        return employee;
    }
}

var FullTime = function () {
    this.hourly = "$12";
};

var PartTime = function () {
    this.hourly = "$11";
};

var Temporary = function () {
    this.hourly = "$10";
};

var Contractor = function () {
    this.hourly = "$15";
};

function run() {

    var employees = [];
    var factory = new Factory();

    employees.push(factory.createEmployee("fulltime"));
    employees.push(factory.createEmployee("parttime"));
    employees.push(factory.createEmployee("temporary"));
    employees.push(factory.createEmployee("contractor"));

    for (var i = 0, len = employees.length; i < len; i++) {
        employees[i].say();
    }
}
```

## Abstract Factory

An _Abstract Factory_ creates objects that are related by a common theme. In object-oriented programming a Factory is an object that creates other objects. An Abstract Factory has abstracted out a theme which is shared by the newly created objects.

Suppose we have two Abstract Factories whose task it is to create page controls, such as, buttons, textboxes, radio buttons, and listboxes. One is the Light Factory which creates controls that are white and the other the Dark Factory which creates controls that are black. Both Factories creates the same types of controls, but they differ in color, which is their common theme. This is an implementation of the Abstract Factory pattern.

![Diagram of abstract factory](../../../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2841%29.png)

```javascript
function Employee(name) {
    this.name = name;

    this.say = function () {
        console.log("I am employee " + name);
    };
}

function EmployeeFactory() {

    this.create = function (name) {
        return new Employee(name);
    };
}

function Vendor(name) {
    this.name = name;

    this.say = function () {
        console.log("I am vendor " + name);
    };
}

function VendorFactory() {

    this.create = function (name) {
        return new Vendor(name);
    };
}

function run() {
    var persons = [];
    var employeeFactory = new EmployeeFactory();
    var vendorFactory = new VendorFactory();

    persons.push(employeeFactory.create("Joan DiSilva"));
    persons.push(employeeFactory.create("Tim O'Neill"));
    persons.push(vendorFactory.create("Gerald Watson"));
    persons.push(vendorFactory.create("Nicole McNight"));

    for (var i = 0, len = persons.length; i < len; i++) {
        persons[i].say();
    }
}

```

## Builder

The _Builder_ pattern allows a client to construct a complex object by specifying the type and content only. Construction details are hidden from the client entirely.

The most common motivation for using Builder is to simplify client code that creates complex objects. The client can still direct the steps taken by the Builder without knowing how the actual work is accomplished. Builders frequently encapsulate construction of Composite objects \(another GoF design pattern\) because the procedures involved are often repetitive and complex.

![Diagram of builder](../../../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2844%29.png)

The JavaScript code has a `Shop` \(the Director\) and two builder objects: `CarBuilder` and `TruckBuilder`. The Shop's construct method accepts a Builder instance which it then takes through a series of assembly steps: step1 and step2. The Builder's get method returns the newly assembled products \(`Car` objects and `Truck` objects\). The client has control over the actual object construction process by offering different builders to the Shop.

```javascript
function Shop() {
    this.construct = function (builder) {
        builder.step1();
        builder.step2();
        return builder.get();
    }
}

function CarBuilder() {
    this.car = null;

    this.step1 = function () {
        this.car = new Car();
    };

    this.step2 = function () {
        this.car.addParts();
    };

    this.get = function () {
        return this.car;
    };
}

function TruckBuilder() {
    this.truck = null;

    this.step1 = function () {
        this.truck = new Truck();
    };

    this.step2 = function () {
        this.truck.addParts();
    };

    this.get = function () {
        return this.truck;
    };
}

function Car() {
    this.doors = 0;

    this.addParts = function () {
        this.doors = 4;
    };

    this.say = function () {
        console.log("I am a " + this.doors + "-door car");
    };
}

function Truck() {
    this.doors = 0;

    this.addParts = function () {
        this.doors = 2;
    };

    this.say = function () {
        console.log("I am a " + this.doors + "-door truck");
    };
}

function run() {
    var shop = new Shop();
    var carBuilder = new CarBuilder();
    var truckBuilder = new TruckBuilder();
    var car = shop.construct(carBuilder);
    var truck = shop.construct(truckBuilder);

    car.say();
    truck.say();
}
```

## Prototype

The _Prototype_ Pattern creates new objects, but rather than creating non-initialized objects it returns objects that are initialized with values it copied from a prototype - or example - object. The Prototype pattern is also referred to as the Properties pattern.

An example of where the Prototype pattern is useful is the initialization of business objects with values that match the default values in the database. The prototype object holds the default values that are copied over into a newly created business object. Classical languages rarely use the Prototype pattern, but JavaScript being a prototypal language uses this pattern in the construction of new objects and their prototypes.

![Diagram of protoype](../../../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2838%29.png)

In the example code we have a `CustomerPrototype` object that clones objects given a prototype object. Its constructor function accepts a prototype of type Customer. Calling the `clone` method will generate a new `Customer` object with its property values initialized with the prototype values.

This is the classical implementation of the Prototype pattern, but JavaScript can do this far more effectively using its built-in prototype facility.

```javascript
function CustomerPrototype(proto) {
    this.proto = proto;

    this.clone = function () {
        var customer = new Customer();

        customer.first = proto.first;
        customer.last = proto.last;
        customer.status = proto.status;

        return customer;
    };
}

function Customer(first, last, status) {

    this.first = first;
    this.last = last;
    this.status = status;

    this.say = function () {
        console.log("name: " + this.first + " " + this.last +
            ", status: " + this.status);
    };
}

function run() {

    var proto = new Customer("n/a", "n/a", "pending");
    var prototype = new CustomerPrototype(proto);

    var customer = prototype.clone();
    customer.say();
}
```

## Singleton

The _Singleton_ Pattern limits the number of instances of a particular object to just one. This single instance is called the singleton.

Singletons are useful in situations where system-wide actions need to be coordinated from a single central place. An example is a database connection pool. The pool manages the creation, destruction, and lifetime of all database connections for the entire application ensuring that no connections are 'lost'.

Singletons reduce the need for global variables which is particularly important in JavaScript because it limits namespace pollution and associated risk of name collisions

![Diagram of Singleton](../../../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2845%29.png)

The `Singleton` object is implemented as an immediate anonymous function. The function executes immediately by wrapping it in brackets followed by two additional brackets. It is called anonymous because it doesn't have a name.

The `getInstance` method is Singleton's gatekeeper. It returns the one and only instance of the object while maintaining a private reference to it which is not accessible to the outside world.

```javascript
var Singleton = (function () {
    var instance;

    function createInstance() {
        var object = new Object("I am the instance");
        return object;
    }

    return {
        getInstance: function () {
            if (!instance) {
                instance = createInstance();
            }
            return instance;
        }
    };
})();

function run() {

    var instance1 = Singleton.getInstance();
    var instance2 = Singleton.getInstance();

    console.log("Same instance? " + (instance1 === instance2));
}
```
