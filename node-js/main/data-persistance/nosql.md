# NoSQL

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2829%29.png)

In SQL the data is stored in tables with the rows and columns, in the NoSQL the data is stored in documents, it doesn't have rows or columns, every entry of the database is a document, that lives in a collection.

This data is stored in JSON or BSON.

![Example for a document in a NoSQL database.](../../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2826%29.png)

This type of database has no relations, meaning that every collection doesn't know anything about others collections, and therefore they cannot share data between them.

 NoSql databases don't have a unified syntax as it has SQL, every database service has its own syntax. 

The most famous/used NoSql databases are: Cassandra, MongoDB or Redis.
