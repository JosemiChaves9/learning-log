# JavaScript Classes



* _Classes_ are templates for objects.
* Javascript calls a _constructor_ method when we create a new instance of a class.
* _Inheritance_ is when we create a parent class with properties and methods that we can extend to child classes.
* We use the `extends` keyword to create a subclass.
* The `super` keyword calls the `constructor()` of a parent class.
* Static methods are called on the class, but not on instances of the class.
