# JavaScript Basis

Print the data in the terminal

```javascript
console.log('to print');
```



The're are 6 fundamental types of data in JavaScript:

* **Strings**
  * Characters wrapped in single `''` or doble quotes `""`.
* **Numbers**
  * Is used to represent positive or negative numbers with or without decimal place `23.584` `1.5e-8`
* **Booleans**
  * The Boolean data type can hold only two values: `true` or `false`.
* **Undefined**
  * The undefined data type can only have one value-the special value `undefined`. If a variable has been declared, but has not been assigned a value, has the value `undefined`.
* **Null**
  * This is another special data type that can have only one value-the `null` value. A `null` value means that there is no value. It is not equivalent to an empty string \(`""`\) or 0, it is simply nothing. `var a = null;`
* **Object**
  * The `object` is a complex data type that allows you to store collections of data.

    An object contains properties, defined as a key-value pair. A property key \(name\) is always a string, but the value can be any data type, like strings, numbers, booleans, or complex data types like arrays, function and other objects. `var varName = { 'key1':'value1' , 'key2':'value2'};`

There is already a built-in objects, which can make us do thing for example `.lenght` to know the characters in a string. Built-in objects are a collections of methods and properties that JavaScript  provides.

We also have built-in arithmetics operators `+, -, *, /, %`
