# ECMAScript

The ECMAScript \(shorted as ES\) is the standard of JavaScript, to ensure the interoperability of web pages across web browsers.

But ECMAScript its a programming language itself, JavaScript can be viewed as a "dialect" of ECMAScript, ECMAScript it's only the standard that mainly all the web programming languages follows.

The first version of ECMAScript was the ES1, published in 1997. The most actual version is ES12 published in June 2020 \(ES13 will be published in June 2021\).

The second major revision was ES6, and it's one of the most importants, and were introduced a lot of new features:

* `let` and `const` keyword \(before was declared with `var`\)
*  Arrow functions
*  Classes
* Promises
* Symbol type
* Default parameter values `(...)` **only when passed to the parameters of the function!!!**
* Function Rest Parameter
* `array.find()`and`array.findIndex()`
* 
ES10 was published in 2019, and had some interesting features:

* `Match.all()`
* Imports can be now assigned to a variable
  * `const module = import module from './modules'`
* `array.flat()`
* `.toString()`
* `...` the spread operator
  * used when want to include the previous data in a new variable `let numberStore = [1, 2, 3, 4]  let newNumber = 12 numberStore = [...numberStore, newNumber] console.log(numberStore) >>> [1, 2, 3, 4, 12]`
