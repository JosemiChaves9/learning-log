# Debugging

## What is debugging?

Debugging is the process of detecting and removing of existing and potential errors \(also called as ‘bugs’\) in a software code that can cause it to behave unexpectedly or crash.

Debugging allows us to stop the execution of the code, and go step by step to see what the code is doing in every line.

## How to debug?

We can debug in the client or in the server:

### Client side

In the client side, we can debug with the builtin debugger of the browser, we can stop the execution by putting a `debugger` in the source code or a breakpoint

Once we put the breakpoint, the execution will stop in this line, and we'll be able to move in the code and see the variables at this time, even if they're not setted in this moment.
