# Debugging

## What is debugging?

Debugging is the process of detecting and removing of existing and potential errors \(also called as ‘bugs’\) in a software code that can cause it to behave unexpectedly or crash.

Debugging allows us to stop the execution of the code, and go step by step to see what the code is doing in every line.

## How to debug?

We can debug in the client or in the server:

### Client side

In the client side, we can debug with the builtin debugger of the browser, we can stop the exectution by putting a `debugger` in the source code or a breakpoint
